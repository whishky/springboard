# springboard

first of all my root is on search form on which you will see the header, you can search any course on the search bar
when you search i am hitting the coursera search api .
it is giving me the list of courses , and i am also getting instructorIds and partnerIds and partnerLogo.
then i prepare partnerurl and instructorurl for bulk hitting.
after hitting both the api i am mapping them with the given Ids in courses.
partnerLogo is given in the courseapi itself.
